Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil." This independence contributes to the overall resilience of the system, as issues in one area do not necessarily cripple the entire application. Additionally, such systems are easier to manage, and monitor, given their modular nature, which simplifies tracking performance and identifying issues.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-native_computing#cite_note-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"> [citation needed]</a></p>
