    <!-- Summary:
    * Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element usually carries the following attributes:
    * Action attribute:
        The <form> element always carries the action attribute.It's value is the URL of the page that will receive the 
        information when the form is submitted.
    * Method attribute:
        The form can be sent using one of two methods,GET and POST.
    1.GET- With the GET method, the values from the <form> are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute.
    The following are further details about the GET method:
       * The length of a URL is limited (2,048 characters).
       * Never use GET to send sensitive data because (data will be visible in the URL).
       * GET method is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google.
       * If the Method attribute is not used,the <form> data will be sent using the GET method.
       * Useful for <form> submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result.
    2.POST- With the POST method,always use POST  if the <form> data contains sensitive or personal information
        (the POST method does not display  the submitted data in the page address field).
        * POST has no size limitations and can be used to send large amounts of data.
        * <form> submission with POST can not be bookmarked.
        * Data Form a <form> is sent as name/value pairs.
        * Form controls may be used to collect data from users. Each <form> control is given aname, and the values of the <br />
        options they select are sent to the server.
